# ðŸ˜± Orion Tech's TX System

After analyzing the performance of recent NFT projects, the Orion Tech Company has designed an innovative internal balance system called "Tech System"

Why implementing this system?

A common transaction Tax in many projects is somewhat high, and even if there is a lot of transaction traffic, the Tax remains the same, which is why in Crypto One, this system will be executed as follows.

* **The number of users trading is less than 400:** A fixed Tax price of $0.20 is established for all types of transactions that are executed within the game.
* **The number of users trading is greater than 400 and less than 800:** A discount of 10% of the Tax Base 0.20$ is established for all types of transactions that are executed within the game.
* **The number of users transacting is in a range from 801 to +âˆž**: A discount of 15% of the Tax Base 0.20$ is established for all types of transactions that are executed within the game.
