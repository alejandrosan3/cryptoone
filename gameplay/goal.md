# ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Once the deck has been shuffled at the beginning of the game, and the 7 cards have been dealt, a face-up card is placed next to the deck as discard, which will be the color or number to be followed. And the cards will begin to be discarded among the players, in a clockwise fashion. If one of the cards is a U-turn, which, if you are playing -for example- from left to right with a blue color and someone throws the blue U-turn, you start playing from right to left.

When each player's turn comes, they are forced to throw a card of the color that is being played or a card with the same number that they have thrown before that turn. For example: if we are playing red and they throw us a red 5 and we have a green 5, we can roll that 5, and the color changes, making the next player continue throwing green. The player must take a card from the deck as a penalty If you don't have a card of the color or number that was dealt to you and you don't have a special card.

The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand. Make sure to press the "ONE" button before throwing your penultimate card otherwise you'll end up penalized with 2 cards from the deck.
