# ðŸ‘œ Market

There will be an internal market where players can upgrade their rooms, Passes, and Tables, allowing them to trade, sell or purchase new things. 

These operations will have a 10% tax for using the market in any of its forms and will be returned to the Rewards Fund.

The marketplace will **use $**CONE as its default token and users will price their item as they see fit, so stay tuned for upcoming deals!

**Expired Passes** cannot be listed on the Marketplace.
