# âš™ Starting in the Crypto world

You will need 3 things to get things rolling in **the Crypto One** Metaverse:

* An installed web3 wallet (metamask recommended)
* **$BNB** to pay GAS fees on Binance Smart Chain Network
* **$CONE** that you can buy at Swaps.

The first step can be taken by reading this document, which should help you install your wallet and BSC Mainnet on it: https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html

After having completed all the steps and having your web3 installed, you can proceed to acquire the $ CONE token in PancakeSwap or Poocoin.
